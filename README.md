Hi!, I'm Mark from Panama with Chinese origin born in February 8 2009. I've been participating in WRO since 2022 and this is my second year participating in the Future Engineers category. I enjoy playing piano and I am a part of a school band, other hobbies include cubing (Rubik's cube competitions), gaming, drawing and writing.

The competition
====

Unlike the structured missions of other WRO categories, Future Engineers presents a broad problem (often related to autonomous vehicles, smart systems, or complex automation), and teams must engineer a full solution. Teams work within defined technical limits (size, cost, sensors, etc.) that mimic real-life engineering conditions. This challenge has two main tasks, the first round which tests the robot's progamming of being able to drive many laps without crashing. The second round adds obstacles that the robot must avoid crashing into and a parking space where the robot should finish.

This challenge emphasizes all aspects of the engineering process, including:

- Mobility: Developing efficient vehicle movement.

- Obstacle managing: Detecting and dodging the different obstacles (Green and Red blocks) with effiency.

- Documentation: Showcasing engineering progress, design planning, and collaboration though a GitHub repository.

Points are awarded based on the performance of the robot. In the first round, points are awarded if the robot does not crash or stop during the round. In the second round, points are awarded for every obstacle the robot is able to detect and avoid, bonus points are rewarded if the robot can succesfully finish in the designated parking space.

Motors, sensors and systems
====
The robot operates with multiple motors and sensors which will be showcased here.

Movement
----
The robot uses motors for drving and steering, these components work together to ensure the robot has a smooth and efficient movement.

|  Voltage |   Current  |   rpm    |  Torque  |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|
|    3     |    160     |   120    |   0.45   |
|    6     |    220     |   200    |    1.0   |
|   7.2    |    250     |   250    |    1.5   |

We chose this motor because it was viable and the one we had already, other motors we used didn't hold up or didn't have enough power to move the wheels. Although there are way better motors we could've bought, we chose this one for its dual motor and it didn't need a driving axle. This made the building process a bit easier and less complicated.

To connect the motor to the skeleton, we made an opening in the skeleton to fit the motor inside, then we held it up with a bent metal sheet and some screws.

The design could be perfected if the skeleton was made to skale with the motor or we had chosen a different motor that not only satisfies what the robot needs but also that it fits confortably to the skeleton.
